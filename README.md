# Contact-Book
Python with SQLite

Everyone uses a contact book to save contact details, including name, address, phone number, and even email address. This is a command-line project 
where I designed a contact book application that users can use to save, find and can delete contact details, and list saved contacts. The SQLite database
is the ideal platform for saving contacts.
